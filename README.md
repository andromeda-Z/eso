### About the project
Our software is based on an earlier incarnation of an unmaintained project named [*esoTalk*](https://github.com/esotalk/esoTalk) headed by <a href="http://tobyzerner.com/">Toby Zerner</a>.  We started a small, private forum by the name of "esotalk.ga" in order to test our fork of the software almost four years ago.  Fast forward to the present: geteso.org has grown into a place for members to discuss what they please.

Changes are always being made as our users [make suggestions on the forum](https://geteso.org/1020/) which is something that we openly encourage.  We are not affiliated with the original *esoTalk* project.

### Creating your own forum
**It's very easy to create your own forum** and requires no command-line experience at all to get started.  **For an extremely novice tutorial, read the [starter's guide](https://github.com/geteso/eso/wiki/Starter's-guide-to-installing-your-forum)**.  Otherwise, dependencies are listed below.

1. PHP `5.6` with the following extensions: `gd`, `mysql`, and `mbstring`.
2. MySQL `5.7` or greater or MariaDB `10` or higher.
2. Apache2; using your own web server will require additional configuration.

You can download the most recent stable release [from the website](https://try.geteso.org) or by using the releases page.  Get support on [geteso.org](https://geteso.org) or by [sending me a message](mailto:grntbg@gmail.com).

### Contributing
I am looking for people to contribute to this project as I do not have much free time and can only push this software forward so much.  If you have made a contribution then you are welcome to create a pull request and you will [become a contributor](https://github.com/geteso/eso/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS).  If you make several contributions and show technical prowice I will add you to this project.

One of the most beneficial ways to help those who run forums using this software is by **creating a plugin, skin or language pack.**  If you are interested, learn more here: https://try.geteso.org
